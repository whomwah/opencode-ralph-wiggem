# Nelson Muntz Plugin for OpenCode

Plan-based iterative development loops for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai). Create structured plans, execute tasks automatically, and commit progress as you go.

> **Why "Nelson Muntz"?** This plugin is loosely based on the [Ralph Wiggum](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/) technique - a simple bash loop that repeatedly feeds an AI agent a prompt until completion. Nelson takes that core idea but adds structured planning, task tracking, and git integration. Since it's evolved beyond the original concept, it got its own Simpsons character. Ha-ha!

## What is Nelson?

Nelson is a development plugin that combines structured planning with automated execution. It works in two modes:

1. **Plan-based mode** (primary): Create a plan with tasks, then let Nelson work through them one by one, committing progress after each task
2. **Direct loop mode** (secondary): Hammer at a single goal until a completion condition is met

The plugin listens for OpenCode's `session.idle` event to continue work automatically, creating a self-referential feedback loop where the AI iteratively builds on its own work.

### Core Workflow

**Plan-based mode** - for structured projects:

```
# Create a plan through conversation:
nm-plan name="my-api"

# Work through tasks automatically:
nm-start

# Loop works through tasks one by one
# Stops when: all tasks marked [x] OR maxIterations reached
```

**Direct loop mode** - for iterative problem-solving:

```
# Start a loop that keeps trying until success:
nm-loop("Make all tests pass", completionPromise: "ALL_TESTS_PASSING", maxIterations: 20)

# Same prompt fed back each iteration
# Stops when: <promise>ALL_TESTS_PASSING</promise> output OR maxIterations reached
```

## Installation

### From npm (recommended for end users)

Add the plugin to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["@whomwah/opencode-nelson-muntz"]
}
```

OpenCode will automatically install it on startup.

### From source (for development)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/whomwah/opencode-nelson-muntz.git
cd opencode-nelson-muntz

# Install dependencies
just install

# Link to OpenCode for local development
just link-local    # Global: ~/.config/opencode/plugin/
just link-project  # Project: .opencode/plugin/
```

## Usage

Nelson's tools are designed to complement OpenCode's built-in Plan and Code modes:

- **OpenCode Plan mode** - For thinking, designing, and conversation without making changes
- **OpenCode Build mode** - For executing tasks and writing code

Nelson's `nm-plan` and `nm-start` tools align with this workflow:

| OpenCode Mode | Nelson Tool | What Happens                                |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Plan mode     | `nm-plan`   | Design and refine your plan in conversation |
| Build mode    | `nm-start`  | Execute tasks, write code, commit changes   |

### Plan Mode

Use OpenCode's Plan mode with `nm-plan` to create and refine your plan _before_ any code is written. This is an iterative conversation where you shape the plan until you're happy with it.

1. **Start planning** - Ask the AI to create a plan:

   ```
   You: "Create a plan for building a REST API for todos"
   ```

   The AI calls `nm-plan` and generates a draft plan, showing it to you in the conversation. **No file is written yet.**

2. **Iterate on the plan** - Refine it through conversation:

   ```
   You: "Add a task for authentication"
   You: "Split the database task into schema design and migrations"
   You: "Remove the Docker task, I'll handle that manually"
   ```

   The AI updates the plan and shows you each revision.

3. **Confirm and save** - When you're satisfied, confirm it:

   ```
   You: "Looks good, save it"
   ```

   The AI calls `nm-plan` with `action='save'` to write the plan file to `.opencode/plans/rest-api.md`.

### Build Mode

Once your plan is saved, switch to OpenCode's Build mode and use `nm-start` to execute tasks. The AI reads the plan file and works through each task.

1. **Start the loop** - Execute all pending tasks automatically:

   ```
   You: "Use nm-start rest-api"
   ```

   Nelson works through each task, marking them complete and creating git commits.

2. **Or run tasks one at a time** - For more control:

   ```
   You: "Use nm-tasks"          # List tasks and their status
   You: "Use nm-task 2"         # Execute task #2 only
   ```

### Available Tools

When the plugin is installed you can ask opencode for all "nm-* tasks" and it will list them.

**Primary tools (plan-based workflow):**

| Tool          | Description                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `nm-plan`     | Create or view a PLAN.md file                          |
| `nm-start`    | Start loop from PLAN.md (auto-commits per task)        |
| `nm-tasks`    | List all tasks from the plan                           |
| `nm-task`     | Execute a single task (auto-completes, no commit)      |
| `nm-complete` | Manually mark a task complete (rarely needed now)      |

**Secondary tools (direct loop mode):**

| Tool                  | Description                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `nm-loop`             | Start loop with direct prompt (advanced, no plan file) |
| `nm-cancel`           | Cancel the active Nelson loop                          |
| `nm-status`           | Check the status of the current loop                   |
| `nm-check-completion` | Manually check if text contains the completion promise |

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.0 or later
- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) installed

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/whomwah/opencode-nelson-muntz.git
cd opencode-nelson-muntz

# Install dependencies
just install

# Type check
just typecheck

# Build for distribution
just build
```

### Tasks

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner. Run `just` with no arguments to see all available tasks.

## Local Files and Folders

Nelson creates files in your project's `.opencode/` directory:

```
.opencode/
├── plans/                      # Your plan files (persistent)
│   ├── my-api.md
│   └── another-project.md
└── nelson-loop.local.json      # Loop state (temporary)
```

### File Details

| File/Folder                        | Purpose                                                              | Lifecycle                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.opencode/plans/`                 | Stores PLAN.md files with your tasks                                 | Persistent - you create and manage these                                              |
| `.opencode/nelson-loop.local.json` | Tracks active loop state (iteration count, current task, session ID) | **Temporary** - created when loop starts, deleted when loop completes or is cancelled |

### Git Recommendations

Add to your `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Nelson Muntz plugin state (temporary, local only)
.opencode/nelson-loop.local.json
```

Your plan files in `.opencode/plans/` can be committed if you want to share them with your team, or gitignored if they're personal.

## How It Works

### Plan-Based Mode (nm-start, nm-task)

1. **Loop Activation**: When you call `nm-start`, the plugin reads PLAN.md and creates a state file at `.opencode/nelson-loop.local.json`

2. **Task Execution**: The plugin generates a prompt for the first pending task and sends it to the AI

3. **Session Monitoring**: The plugin listens for the `session.idle` event which fires when the AI finishes its response

4. **Task Completion**: When idle, the plugin marks the current task as `[x]` in PLAN.md and (in loop mode) creates a git commit

5. **Loop Continuation**: The plugin finds the next pending task and sends a new prompt. If no pending tasks remain, the loop ends.

6. **Safety Stop**: If `maxIterations` is reached before all tasks complete, the loop halts entirely for human review

### Direct Loop Mode (nm-loop)

1. **Loop Activation**: When you call `nm-loop`, the plugin stores your prompt and creates a state file

2. **Same Prompt Each Time**: Unlike plan-based mode, the exact same prompt is fed back each iteration

3. **Completion Detection**: The plugin checks the AI's output for `<promise>YOUR_TEXT</promise>` tags matching your completion promise

4. **Iterative Improvement**: The AI sees files modified by previous attempts, allowing it to build on its own work

5. **Stops When**: The completion promise is detected OR maxIterations is reached

## When to Use Nelson

### Plan-based mode (`nm-start`) is good for:

- Multi-step projects with distinct phases
- Greenfield development where you want git commits per task
- Projects where you want to review progress task-by-task

### Direct loop mode (`nm-loop`) is good for:

- "Make the tests pass" - iterate until green
- "Fix the build errors" - hammer until it compiles
- Bug hunting - keep trying fixes until resolved
- Any goal with clear, verifiable success criteria

### Not good for:

- One-shot operations that don't benefit from iteration
- Tasks with unclear success criteria
- Production debugging (use targeted debugging instead)
